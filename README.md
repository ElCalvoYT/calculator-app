# Web-Based Calculator App

## Overview

This is a web-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder). The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple user interface and functionality directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication (×)**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division (÷)**: Divides the first number by the second. Handles division by zero with an error message.
- **Modulus (%)**: Calculates the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
